  <br/>
  
I am a Backend Developer with 1 years of experience in developing applications or software.

### My Opensource Story
All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub, this includes some of my GitHub trending projects:
- [GunTour](https://github.com/GunTour/Back-End) - An application to help mountaineers who want to book tickets, hire a ranger and rental goods for climbing. This project contains database using MySQL, ORM using GORM, a container using docker, server using AWS EC2, and external API using Google Calendar API, Gmail API, and Midtrans API.
- [Healtymart](https://github.com/E-Commerce-App-Team-5/Back-End) - people who want to be a seller and a buyer at the same time in this application. this app can be used for selling vegetables and fruits and has integrated with a payment gateway system which easier to pay.
- [InFTSeries](https://github.com/khalidrianda/InFTSeries) - An application to forecast data using the fuzzy times series method which is intended to complete a college thesis. This project using framework CodeIgniter, and MySQL.

I learned C, Java, and PHP when I was in college and took some classes for mastering the backend with go and I still want learning more about programming, and apply it for better purposes.
